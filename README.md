## TDD: `factorial` example

In folder [`factorial`][fact:dir] there's the port in Python of the code seen in class, which was implemented in Java.
If you're using VIM, evaluate the command `:source commands.vim`, being in that directory, in order to map
`<F3>` key to run test cases instead of typing `!make` command each time.
